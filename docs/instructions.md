Technical Assessment: Music app interface using the Deezer API

Objective: Develop a simple web application using React and Next.js that interfaces with the Deezer API to search for artists and display their albums and songs.

## Core Features:

### Search Functionality:

Implement a search box to search for artists using the Deezer API. Register a free account.

Display search results in a user-friendly format.

### Albums Listing:

When an artist or band is selected from the search results, display a list of their albums.

Ensure efficient and responsive fetching and rendering of data.

### Album Details:

Upon selecting an album, display a detailed list of songs from that album.

Include relevant album information such as release date, genre, etc.

## Technical Requirements:

### React and Next.js:

Utilize React for building the user interface.

Leverage Next.js features such as server-side rendering or static generation for optimal performance and SEO.

Implement responsive design for various devices and screen sizes.

### Code Quality:

Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

Follow best practices for React and JavaScript/TypeScript.

Use appropriate React hooks and context APIs where necessary.

### State Management:

Efficiently manage application state (consider using Context API, Redux, or similar).

Handle asynchronous operations and API responses effectively.

### Security:

Implement necessary security measures to protect the application from common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

Securely handle API keys and sensitive data.

### Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling and user feedback for API errors or UI issues.

### Testing:

Write unit tests for key components and functionality.

Include instructions for running the tests in your documentation.

## Next.js Specific:

Routing:

Utilize Next.js routing for navigating between different parts of the application.

### API Routes:

Implement server-side logic, if needed, using Next.js API routes.

### Optimization:

Leverage Next.js optimizations like image optimization, lazy loading, and code splitting.

## Submission Guidelines:

Provide the source code in a clean, organized repository (e.g., GitHub).

Include a README file with:

- Clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- Explanation of design decisions and architecture.
- Any assumptions made during the development process.

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality: Fulfillment of the core features and technical requirements.
- Code Quality: Readability, structure, and adherence to best practices.
- Design and User Experience: Aesthetic appeal and ease of use.
- Security and Error Handling: Robustness and resilience of the application.
- Performance: Efficiency of the code and use of Next.js features.
